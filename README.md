# Tales of OldMan (Vintage Story "ModPack")

Tales of OldMan is a collection of features/additions to Vintage Story that both allow me to implement(learn how) several features
i find useful and are segregated among several other mods and sometimes come with additional features and unwanted overhead. This also
surges from the boredom that is managing mod versions (specially when you have a good amount of them just for some 
particular functionality)

# Dependencies

This "Mod" depends on 
- [ConfigLib](https://mods.vintagestory.at/configlib)
- [VSImGui](https://mods.vintagestory.at/imgui)

You should be prompted to install them when you try to start the game with this mod and they're
not present.


# Acknowledgement/Inspirations

Although i'm providing this for free and open source under highly permissive license, i will 
acknowledge whenever possible the mods that have been included, served as inspiration, or 
individually provide similar functionality. 

I'll always recomend that you choose using those particular mods instead of this one if you're
interested only in a subset of functionalities.
